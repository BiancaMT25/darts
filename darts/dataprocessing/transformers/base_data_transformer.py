        Base class for data transformers. The class offers the method `transform`, for applying a transformation
        to a TimeSeries or Sequence of TimeSeries. The transformation function must be passed during the
        transformer's initialization. This class takes care of parallelizing the transformation of multiple
        TimeSeries when possible.

        Data transformers requiring to be fit first before calling `transform()` should derive
        from `FittableDataTransformer` instead.
        Data transformers that are invertible should derive from ´InvertibleDataTransformer´ instead.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ts_transform (Callable)
            The function that will be applied to each TimeSeries object once the `transform()` function is called. The
            function must take as first argument a TimeSeries object, and return the transformed TimeSeries object.
            Additional parameters can be added if necessary, but in this case, the `_transform_iterator()` should be
            redefined accordingly, to yield the necessary arguments to this function (See `_transform_iterator()` for
            further details)
        name
            The data transformer's name
        n_jobs
            The number of jobs to run in parallel. Parallel jobs are created only when a Sequence[TimeSeries] is passed
            as input to a method, parallelising operations regarding different TimeSeries. Defaults to `1` (sequential).
            Setting the parameter to `-1` means using all the available processors.
            Note: for a small amount of data, the parallelisation overhead could end up increasing the total
            required amount of time.
        verbose
            Optionally, whether to print operations progress
        kwargs
            Additional keyword arguments

        """
        Returns an `Iterator` object with tuples of inputs for each single call to `ts_transform()`.
        Additional `args` and `kwargs` from `transform()` (that don't change across the calls to `ts_transform()`)
        are already forwarded, and thus don't need to be included in this generator.

        The basic implementation of this method returns `zip(series)`, i.e., a generator of single-valued tuples,
        each containing one TimeSeries object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series (Sequence[TimeSeries])
            Sequence of TimeSeries received in input.

        Returns
        -------
        Iterator[Tuple[TimeSeries]]
            An iterator containing tuples of inputs for the `ts_transform()` method.
